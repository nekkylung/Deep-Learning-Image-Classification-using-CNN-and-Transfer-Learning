# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification-using-CNN-and-Transfer-Learning
First build a CNN model from scratch to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into predefined categories. Then, we implement a transfer learning approach using the pre-trained MobileNet model. Finally, we compare the performance of the custom CNN and the transfer learning model based on evaluation metrics and analysis.
